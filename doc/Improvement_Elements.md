# Data Element Definitions for AI Use Case Analysis Framework

## Improvement Elements

### Problem Statement [problem_statement]
**Definition**: A structured articulation of the operational challenge or issue that the AI implementation addresses.

**Characteristics**:
- Begins with "The problem is..." or "Currently..."
- Describes specific operational challenges
- Identifies affected stakeholders and impacts
- Provides relevant context for significance
- Focuses on problem description without solutions
- Must be concise and avoid verbosity

**Format**: Continuous prose paragraph
**Source**: Generated via analysis of use case details, purpose/benefits, and outputs
**Usage**: Foundational element for understanding implementation value

### Solution Assertion [solution_assertion]
**Definition**: A comprehensive description of how the AI implementation addresses the identified problem.

**Characteristics**:
- Contains four distinct sections:
  1. Solution Description
  2. AI-Driven Approach
  3. Measurable Impacts
  4. Solution Summary
- Maps solution components to problem elements
- Details specific technologies and methodologies
- Identifies concrete operational impacts
- Provides implementation context

**Format**: Structured text with defined sections
**Length**: Approximately 250 words
**Usage**: Enables assessment of solution completeness and alignment

### Value Category [value_category]
**Definition**: Classification of the AI implementation's primary transformative impact into one of three standardized categories.

**Valid Values**:
- Efficiency Amplifier
- Capability Enhancer
- Breakthrough Enabler

**Format**: Single categorical value
**Validation**: Must match exactly one of the defined categories
**Usage**: Enables systematic analysis of transformation patterns

### Value Category Rationale [value_category_rationale]
**Definition**: Detailed justification for the assigned value category, connecting specific implementation features to category criteria.

**Characteristics**:
- Structured in five sections:
  1. Introduction
  2. Point 1 (Feature/Impact)
  3. Point 2 (Operational Boundaries)
  4. Point 3 (Outcomes)
  5. Conclusion
- References specific implementation details
- Provides logical connection to category
- Avoids generic statements

**Format**: Structured text with defined sections
**Length**: Approximately 300 words
**Usage**: Documents category assignment reasoning

### Technical Elements [technical_elements]
**Definition**: Comprehensive analysis of technical components and requirements necessary for implementation.

**Characteristics**:
Three main sections:
1. Technical Architecture Overview
   - Architecture description
   - Dependencies
   - System interactions
   - Performance considerations
   - Security requirements

2. Technical Components List with categories:
   - Data
   - AI/ML
   - Infrastructure
   - Integration
   - Operations

3. Implementation Considerations
   - Technical risks
   - Dependencies
   - Performance requirements
   - Security requirements
   - Scaling considerations

**Format**: Structured text with defined sections
**Special Requirements**: Must include COMPONENTS: section in specified format
**Usage**: Supports technical planning and implementation

### Stakeholders [stakeholders]
**Definition**: Analysis of roles, responsibilities, and relationships of all parties affected by or involved in the AI implementation.

**Characteristics**:
Organized into three main categories:
1. Mission Interests
   - Subject Matter Experts
   - Field Personnel
   - Supervisory Staff

2. External Stakeholders
   - Partner Agencies
   - Regulated Entities
   - Private Sector Interests
   - Public Impact

**Format**: Structured list by category
**Requirements**: Must identify specific roles rather than generic groups
**Usage**: Enables comprehensive impact analysis and engagement planning

## Relationships and Dependencies

These improvement elements form an interconnected analytical framework:

1. Problem Statement → Solution Assertion
   - Solution must directly address identified problem elements

2. Solution Assertion → Value Category
   - Category assignment based on solution characteristics

3. Value Category → Value Category Rationale
   - Rationale must support category selection with evidence

4. Solution Assertion → Technical Elements
   - Technical components must support solution requirements

5. All Elements → Stakeholders
   - Stakeholder analysis informed by all other elements
