## Risk Factors
- Streamlit state management complexity
- Integration points with LLM backend
- Session persistence reliability
- User experience consistency

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Basic Streamlit Framework
2. Parallel planning of LLM Backend track
3. Team strength assessment for task assignment
4. Development environment setup
5. Initial sprint planning
