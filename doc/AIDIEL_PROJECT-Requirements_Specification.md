And their responses should be saved automatically
And they should see a progress indicator
```

**User Stories:**
1. "As a user, I need to be automatically assigned a unique session ID when I start a new interview so that my work is properly tracked"

   - Create UI component for progress bar
   - Implement state management for progress tracking

#### GWTS-2: Session Resume
```gherkin
Given a user has a saved session
When they return to the system
And enter their session ID
Then their previous responses should be loaded
And they should be able to continue from their last point
```

**User Stories:**
1. "As a user, I need to easily resume my previous session so I can complete my interview over multiple sessions"
   - Create session lookup mechanism
   - Implement state restoration
   - Add validation for session access

2. "As a user, I want to see my previous responses when I resume so I can review my progress"
   - Implement response history display
   - Create response recovery mechanism
   - Add session state verification

### 2.2 Linguistic Controls

#### GWTS-3: Linguistic Controls Management
```gherkin
Given a user is in an interview session
When they adjust a Linguistic Potentiometer control
Then the AI's response depth/creativity/technical level should adjust accordingly
And the change should be reflected immediately in subsequent responses
```

**User Stories:**
1. "As a user, I need to adjust the AI's response characteristics so I can get the most appropriate output for my needs"
   - Create LP control UI components
   - Implement response adjustment logic

### 2.3 Interview System

#### GWTS-4: Interview Process
```gherkin
Given a user is in an active interview session

### 2.4 Feedback and Learning Loop

#### GWTS-5: Feedback Collection
```gherkin
Given the system has generated AI use case recommendations
When a user provides feedback on the suggestions

### 2.5 Data Management & Security

#### GWTS-6: Data Isolation
```gherkin
Given multiple users are accessing the system simultaneously
When they perform interview sessions
Then each user's data should be isolated in separate sessions
And no user should be able to access another user's data

Given a system error occurs during user interaction
When the error is detected
Then appropriate error messages should be shown to the user
And the error should be logged with context
And the system should attempt recovery where possible
```
